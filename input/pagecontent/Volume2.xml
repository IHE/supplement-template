<p><em>&lt;The assignment and use of role names in transaction specifications has proved to be very effective/efficient in Radiology, especially when existing transactions are re-used by additional actors.

<p>The roles in this transaction are defined in the following table and may be played by the actors shown here:</p>

<p>Figure 3.Y.4-1: Interaction Diagram</p>
<h4 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.1-message-1-name">3.Y.4.1 &lt;Message 1 Name&gt;</h4>
<p>&lt;One or two sentence summary of what Message 1 accomplishes typically relating the message to the relevant standard. Avoid shall language in this upper level section. Do not duplicate the triggers, encoding, semantics, standards used, or expected actions. Those belong in the following sections.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Explicitly state if the multiplicity of an actor may be greater than one; i.e., if an actor (whether it is a client or server) can expect this message from a single source or multiple sources.&gt;</p>
<h5 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.1.1-trigger-events">3.Y.4.1.1 Trigger Events</h5>
<p>&lt;Description of the real world events that cause the sender (Actor A) to send Message 1 (e.g., an operator or an automated function determines that a new workitem is needed).&gt;</p>
<h5 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.1.2-message-semantics">3.Y.4.1.2 Message Semantics</h5>
<p>&lt;Detailed description of the meaning, structure and contents of the message, including any IHE specific clarifications of the message format, attributes, etc.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Start by describing the standard underlying the message and how the participating actors are mapped (e.g., “This message is a DICOM C-FIND Request. Actor A is the SCU. Actor D is the SCP.”).&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Continue profiling the message by providing guidance or constraints on how the message parameters are populated, how the payload is encoded, how the message is structured and what the contents mean. These message semantics should both help the sender to construct the message and the receiver to interpret the message.&gt;</p>
<h5 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.1.3-expected-actions">3.Y.4.1.3 Expected Actions</h5>
<p>&lt;Description of the actions expected to be taken as a result of sending or receiving this message.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Describe what the receiver is expected/required to do upon receiving this message. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Avoid re-iterating the transaction sequencing specified in the Profile Process Flows as expected actions internal to the transaction. Doing so prevents this transaction being re-used in other contexts.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Explicitly define any expected action based on the multiplicity of an actor(s), if applicable.&gt;</p>
<h4 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.2-message-2-name">3.Y.4.2 &lt;Message 2 Name&gt;</h4>
<p>&lt;One or two sentence summary of what Message 2 accomplishes typically relating the message to the relevant standard. Avoid shall language in this upper level section. Do not duplicate the triggers, encoding, semantics, standards used, or expected actions. Those belong in the following sections.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Explicitly state if the multiplicity of an actor may be greater than one; i.e., if an actor (whether it is a client or server) can expect this message from a single source or multiple sources.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Repeat this section as necessary based on the number of messages in the interaction diagram.&gt;</p>
<h5 class="list-paragraph" id="y.4.2.1-trigger-events">3.Y.4.2.1 Trigger Events</h5>
<p>&lt;Description of the real world events that cause the sender (Actor A) to send Message 1(e.g., an operator or an automated function determines that a new workitem is needed).&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Describe what the receiver is expected/required to do upon receiving this message. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Avoid re-iterating the transaction sequencing specified in the Profile Process Flows as expected actions internal to the transaction. Doing so prevents this transaction being re-used in other contexts.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Explicitly define any expected action based on the multiplicity of an actor(s), if applicable.&gt;</p>
<h3 class="list-paragraph" id="y.5-protocol-requirements">3.Y.5 Protocol Requirements</h3>
<p>&lt;In this section, the selected protocol bindings of the transactions are explained in detail (like SOAP or HTTP bindings).For an example, see the QRPH DEX Profile or ITI TF-2b:3.34.5, 3.35.5. Indicate NA if not used.&gt;</p>
<h3 class="list-paragraph" id="y.6-security-considerations">3.Y.6 Security Considerations</h3>
<p>&lt;Description of the transaction specific security consideration; such as use of security profiles.&gt;</p>
<h4 class="list-paragraph" id="y.6.1-security-audit-considerations">3.Y.6.1 Security Audit Considerations</h4>
<p>&lt;This section should identify any specific ATNA security audit event that is associated with this transaction and requirements on the encoding of that audit event. &gt;</p>
<h5 class="list-paragraph" id="y.6.z-actor-specific-security-considerations">3.Y.6.(z) &lt;Actor&gt; Specific Security Considerations</h5>
<p>&lt;This section should specify any specific security considerations on an actor-by-actor basis.&gt;</p>
